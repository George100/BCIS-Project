Journey Board prototype1 readme
<p> 23/05/2016: prototype 1 with popups, menu, settngs, bv & av
Changes:
- canvas drawn pop up windows
- settings stay set throughout screens
- tiles with text displaying their phase info
- larger centered somewhat adaptive canvas view
- smooth UI flow
- better gfx for avatar view

BUGS:
- avatarview 'draw' can only be called once for some reason then the
button breaks.
- sometimes UI flow will stutter or go to the wrong screen but only if
you really try to break it.</p>

<p>12/05/2016: main code cleaned and commented. libraries added. open attempt1.html to test in the browser. To use js bin you will need to copy the js libraries into <script></script> tags in the html side of jsbin.com and the main 'attempt1.js' code into the javascript tab. - Connor. </p>
